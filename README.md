# EightQueensSolver
EightQueensSolver is a JavaFX application that solves 8 queens puzzles. It uses a hill climbing algorithm with random restarts. You can choose the starting positions of the queens.
## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Change directory to EightQueensSolver
3. Do `./gradlew run` or `.\gradlew.bat run` if you're on Windows
## Usage
Click and drag the queens to desired positions. You're only allowed to move a queen within its column. Click the start button to start the algorithm. If the queens start moving faster than normal, that means a restart is taking place. The number of moves and restarts will be printed in the console.
